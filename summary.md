### Chapter 2 - The sound system: phonology
#### 2.1: Introduction
The introduction part outlines the fundamental concept of phonology as the study of abstract categories that organize the sound system of a language. Rather than merely perceiving or producing sound waves, speakers and listeners mentally categorize sounds into abstract units. Mastering this sound system is essential for speaking and understanding a language. Phonology encompasses individual speech sounds as well as their organization into larger units like syllables and words.

_The chapter's structure is detailed:_

- **Introduction to Phonology**: Using the English "r-sound" as an example, Section 2.2 will elucidate why abstract categories are necessary to describe the sound system of a language.

- **Methodology**: Section 2.3 will introduce the methodology used to determine which sounds are grouped into which categories in English.
- **Analysis of Phonemes**: Section 2.4 will analyze a selection of intriguing English phonemes based on the established methodology.

- **Syllable Structure**: Section 2.5 will focus on the syllable as a higher-level phonological unit that organizes sounds in spoken language.

This introduction serves as a roadmap for understanding the principles and methods of phonological analysis, using the English language as an illustrative example. It emphasizes the abstract nature of phonological categories and their crucial role in organizing and comprehending spoken language.


#### 2.2: Introducing order into the chaos: the phoneme
The subchapter 2.2 discusses the perception of the sound [ɹ] in various English words and introduces the concept of phonemes and allophones.

It begins by examining three words - "rip," "wrap," and "rope" - each containing the sound [ɹ]. Spectrogram images are provided to illustrate the acoustic properties of this sound. Despite differences in spectrograms, the sound [ɹ] is perceived similarly in all three words.

Next, the text compares the words "rip," "wrap," and "rope" to "trip," "trap," and "trope." Although all six words contain the letter "r," the sound [ɹ] is not uniformly present. Spectrogram analysis reveals distinct acoustic patterns between the two sets of words. Additionally, a tactile experiment involving the larynx highlights differences in the production of the [ɹ] sound.

The concept of phonemes is introduced as abstract mental categories that organize speech sounds. Phonemes are contrasted with phones, which are physical realizations of speech sounds. Allophones are phones that function as alternative realizations of the same phoneme.

This subchapter then discusses transcription methods, including narrow transcription, which provides detailed articulatory information. It emphasizes the use of phonetic evidence rather than orthography in analyzing sound structures.

Furthermore, the text explores the complementary distribution of allophones, using the example of [ɹ] and [ɹ̥] in English. This distribution suggests that [ɹ] and [ɹ̥] are allophones of the same phoneme.

Finally, this part of the chapter draws an analogy between complementary distribution in linguistics and states of matter in chemistry. It concludes by posing questions about investigating phoneme systems in languages and the challenges posed by speakers' lack of awareness of these systems.

#### 2.3: The key to finding the order

The text delves into strategies for investigating how languages categorize sounds into phonemes and allophones.

**2.3.1 Minimal Pairs:**
The first strategy involves examining the system of phonemes and understanding what distinguishes it from a random collection of phones. Phonemes are defined as units that, when replaced, can change the meaning of a word, unlike allophones. For instance, replacing the English phoneme /ɹ/ in "wrap" with another phoneme yields a different word, while replacing its allophones ([ɹ] and [ɹ̥]) only results in ill-formed words. Minimal pairs, such as "lap" and "map," are used to illustrate this concept, where a single sound change alters the meaning.

**2.3.2 Distributional Characteristics of Allophones:**
The second strategy examines the properties of allophones, focusing on complementary distribution and free variation. Allophones may exhibit complementary distribution, as seen in the distinct realizations of /p/ in word-medial and word-final positions. However, some allophones, like [p] and [p̚], show free variation, where speakers can choose between them without altering meaning. The text introduces systematic definitions and notational conventions for analyzing different phonetic contexts within words.

**2.3.3 Observing Allophonic Alternations in Different Word Forms:**
The third strategy involves analyzing different word forms to observe alternations between allophones. By changing word forms, phonetic contexts can be manipulated to reveal different allophones. For example, the English verb "clap" exhibits a released [p] in its infinitive form but an unreleased [p̚] in its present participle form "clapping." Similarly, in German, the words "Rad" and "Rat" appear to end in the same sound, but analyzing their plural forms reveals they belong to different phonemes (/d/ and /t/, respectively) due to alternations in word-final contexts.

The text concludes by emphasizing the methodological ground for investigating phoneme systems, highlighting the importance of minimal pairs tests, and the distributional characteristics of allophones in determining phoneme status. It previews the application of these strategies to further explore the phoneme inventory of English.

#### 2.4: More about the sound system of English
This section delves into the intricacies of English phonology, focusing on the allophones (different realizations) of specific sounds like /l/ and /r/ in various phonetic contexts.

**Allophones of /l/:**

/l/ has three main realizations: [l], [l̥], and [ɫ].
[l] is the voiced allophone, occurring initially in words like "lap."
[l̥] is the voiceless allophone, occurring after voiceless stops, as in "clap."
[ɫ] is the velarized or "dark" allophone, found in word-final positions, sounding darker than [l].
The distinction between "clear" [l] and "dark" [ɫ] lies in the position of the tongue, with [ɫ] involving the raising of the back of the tongue towards the velum.
The distribution of [ɫ] and [l] is complementary, meaning they don't occur in the same phonetic context. [:] is found word-finally, while [l] occurs word-initially and between vowels.
The presence of [ɫ] and [l] can be determined through complementary distribution rather than free variation, as they never occur together.

**Stop Phonemes:**

Stops like /p/, /t/, and /k/ have allophones including unreleased, aspirated, and non-aspirated variants.
Aspiration occurs mainly in word-initial positions or after /s/ before a vowel.
Aspirated stops are perceived as typical in English, leading to the misconception that unaspirated stops are voiced when heard in isolation.

**Complex Case of /r/:**

/r/ has various allophones, including a tap ([ɾ]) and [r].
Between vowels, /r/ can be realized as either [ɾ] or [r], but these variations don't affect meaning.
In RP English, /r/ tends not to be pronounced in word-final positions, making it a non-rhotic variety.
However, /r/ is not absent in these contexts but rather not pronounced.
Allophones of /r/ vary depending on phonetic contexts, including [ɾ], [r], or even a zero allophone in some cases.
The presence or absence of /r/ in various phonetic contexts can be determined through complementary distribution.
Rhotic varieties, like General American English, pronounce /r/ consistently in word-final positions.
